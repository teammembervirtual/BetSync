üí∞ Economics
Fee Structure

Platform Fee: 3% of gross winnings
Gas Fees: Standard Stacks transaction fees apply

Payout Calculation
Gross Payout = User Contribution + (User Contribution √ó Losing Pool / Winning Pool)
Net Payout = Gross Payout - Platform Fee (3%)
Example

Pool A: 1000 STX, Pool B: 2000 STX
Your bet: 100 STX on Pool A (wins)
Gross payout: 100 + (100 √ó 2000 / 1000) = 300 STX
Platform fee: 300 √ó 0.03 = 9 STX
Net payout: 291 STX

üîí Security Features

Input Validation: All user inputs are thoroughly validated
Access Control: Only pool creators can resolve outcomes
Deadline Enforcement: Bets only accepted before deadlines
Double-spending Prevention: Claims can only be made once
State Consistency: Atomic operations ensure data integrity
